Review of chapter 3 - function vs scope

- Just like you can hide functions and variables within a function declaration, you can also enclose code within ``{}`` if you want to hide variables and functions from the rest of the code 

- Let and var have different behaviours in a for loop

- Difference between a function declaration and a function expression is whether the function keyword comes first before anything else in the line of code. IIFE is a function expression because ot the placement of the paranthesis before the function keyword like so: (function printName())()
