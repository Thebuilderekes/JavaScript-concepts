# Hoisting

Ther are 2 types of declarations that get hoisted:
- Function declaration
- Variable declaration

Functions get hoisted before variables``

given this code: var a = 5

During the code execution, the javascript engine sees this as 2 statements.
var a; and a = 5; declaration and assignment.

variable declaration is part of the compilation phase while variable assignment is part of thre execution phae in the javascript engine.
