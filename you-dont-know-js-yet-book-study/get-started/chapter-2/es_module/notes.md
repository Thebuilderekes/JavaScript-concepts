# ES Modules

ES modules allows for a modular flow of writing javascript in the sense that it allows us to pass functions and parameters for use using `import` statements right at the top of file as seen in the js files within this folder.

`blogpost.js` which receives the function from `publication.js`, shares its functions with `main.js`.
