// Globals and var, let, and const

// The keywords var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript. var has been around since the beginning of the language, while let and const are significantly newer additions (added in ES6).

// Only declaring variables with the var keyword will add them to the window object. If you declare a variable outside of a function with either let or const, it will not be added as a property to the window object.

// let currentlyEating = 'ice cream';

// window.currentlyEating === currentlyEating 
// false!
